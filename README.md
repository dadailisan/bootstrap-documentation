#bootstrap-documentation

This shows the the codes and comments i gained from reading bootstrap v4.1.3 documentation.

index1.html --> shows the introduction and overview of the things included on the documentation. also the stater template is useful since i copy paste it everytime i create a html file.

index2.html --> shows the viewport breakpoints which is helpful to understand a responsive page. discussions about columns, rows, alignments are on this page. i also added a css file for better understanding on how the text/margins/paddings behave inside the div.

index3.html --> shows the media and media-body classes that is helpful to give a blogpost like contents. alignments/margins/paddings are also used on this page. the last part are mostly an overview of what other classes/utilities that can be used alongside media.

index4.html -->highlights the reboot, this page serves as lessons thats why i commented out the most part.

index5.html -->shows the html headings and bootstrap classes counterpart, html5 inline element and bootstrap inline classes. lists and other types of typography classes.
